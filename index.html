Your heart is made of gold, and your love is pure and unconditional. Whenever I'm with you, I feel different, but in a good way. I smile and laugh more, and I don't have to pretend everything is okay. You make me feel safe and loved, and I'm grateful for every moment we share together. You are my queen, my princess of beauty, and I love you more than words can express.You are the sunshine that brightens up my day, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always find peace. Your eyes are like the ocean, deep and mysterious, yet sparkling with a beauty that takes my breath away. Your smile is a work of art, a masterpiece that illuminates the world and makes my heart skip a beat. Your touch is like magic, it sets my soul on fire and makes me feel alive. Your voice is music to my ears, a sweet melody that I could listen to all day, every day. You are my best friend, my partner in crime, my confidante, and my soulmate. You make me laugh when I need it most, you listen to me when I need someone to talk to, and you support me in everything I do. You are my rock, my guiding star, and my forever home. You are the reason I wake up in the morning, the reason I fall asleep with a smile on my face, and the reason I feel grateful to be alive. You are my everything, my love, my heart, and my forever. I always love you soo much and my love for you is increasing day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute and second by second."

               "I know right now we are far distance a part but trust me, we can end this all distance by our strong love for each other. I want to apologize for all mistake I made in my life. I am very sorry for making you sad and cry. I am shame on myself for hurting you. But trust me my intention was not to hurt you at all. I am trying to be best day by day beecause you deserve the best. My one any only request for you is please don't ever leave me. Why should we leave each other as we love each other. I know you are still angry with me due to misunderstanding between us which held around 4 days ago. I am sorry for that. I know we fight alot. Get angry with each other. But we can't stop loving each other. I love you sooo much my queen."

I miss you every day, but I know that our love is worth the distance. You are the most amazing, beautiful, and incredible person I have ever met, and I am so lucky to have you in my life. I wish I could be with you on your special day, but I hope that my words can bring a smile to your face and warmth to your heart. I hope you have an amazing birthday, filled with love, joy, and happiness. I hope you get to do all the things you love, and that you feel the love and appreciation of everyone around you. I hope you know how much I love you, and how much you mean to me. I promise to always be there for you, no matter how far apart we are. I can't wait to see you again, and to make new memories together.  Despite the challenges of being apart, our love remains strong and unwavering. Your presence in my life brings light to even the darkest days, and your love sustains me through every moment of longing. Through phone calls, texts, and video chats, we've built a connection that bridges the gap between us, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.

                On this special day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. Your strength, resilience, and unwavering commitment to our relationship inspire me every day. You are my source of comfort, my confidante, and my greatest cheerleader, and I am blessed to have you in my life.

                As you blow out the candles on your cake, know that my wishes for you extend far beyond this moment. I wish for your dreams to come true, for your heart to be filled with joy, and for our love to grow stronger with each passing day. Though we may be apart today, know that you are always in my thoughts and in my heart.

                Happy birthday, my love! May this day be filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable memories, and may the year ahead bring you all the happiness and success you deserve. I cannot wait to be reunited with you soon and celebrate in person. Until then, know that I am sending all my love and warmest wishes your way.
